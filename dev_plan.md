## Development Plan: Satellite Ground Station Location Optimization Tool

### Phase 1: Database Setup and Data Ingestion (Week 1-2)

#### 1.1 Database Configuration
- Set up PostGIS extension in the existing `sgs` PostgreSQL database
- Create spatial reference system configurations for Australian projections (GDA2020, MGA zones)
- Design database schema for:
  - Mobile infrastructure tables (Telstra, Optus, TPG sites)
  - NBN coverage areas (fixed line, wireless)
  - Elevation data (when obtained)
  - Population/demographic data (when obtained)
  - Candidate ground station sites

#### 1.2 Data Ingestion Scripts
Create Python scripts using libraries like:
- `geopandas` for shapefile/CSV processing
- `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL connectivity
- `fiona` for KML/geospatial format handling

**Priority order:**
1. Mobile carrier CSV data → PostgreSQL tables
2. NBN shapefile data → PostGIS spatial tables
3. Optus KML coverage → PostGIS geometry
4. Set up data validation and integrity checks

### Phase 2: Backend API Development (Week 3-4)

#### 2.1 Technology Choice
**Recommendation: Node.js + Express** (simpler than Django for this use case)
- Express.js with `pg` (PostgreSQL driver)
- Spatial query support via raw SQL to PostGIS
- RESTful API design

#### 2.2 Core API Endpoints
```
GET /api/datasets - List available datasets
POST /api/datasets/upload - Upload new geospatial data
GET /api/infrastructure/mobile - Mobile tower locations with filters
GET /api/infrastructure/nbn - NBN coverage areas
GET /api/analysis/sites - Generate candidate ground station locations
POST /api/analysis/custom - Custom analysis with user parameters
GET /api/sites/:id/reasoning - Detailed reasoning for specific site
```

#### 2.3 Spatial Analysis Engine
- Implement multi-factor scoring algorithms
- Proximity analysis functions (distance to backhaul, population centers)
- Elevation and terrain analysis (when DEM data is added)
- RF interference assessment logic

### Phase 3: Frontend Development (Week 5-6)

#### 3.1 React Application Setup
- Create React app with TypeScript
- Install React-Leaflet and mapping dependencies
- Set up responsive layout with modern UI (Material-UI or Tailwind CSS)

#### 3.2 Map Components
- Interactive map with multiple layer controls
- Base map layers (OpenStreetMap, satellite imagery)
- Data overlay layers:
  - Mobile tower markers (color-coded by carrier)
  - NBN coverage polygons
  - Candidate ground station sites
- Pop-up components with detailed site information

#### 3.3 Analysis Interface
- Parameter weighting controls (sliders/inputs)
- Scenario configuration panel
- Results dashboard with sortable site rankings
- Detailed reasoning panels for each recommended site

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 7-8)

#### 4.1 Additional Data Integration
- Implement elevation data ingestion (ELVIS API integration)
- Add population density data (ABS APIs)
- Crown land availability data integration

#### 4.2 Enhanced Analysis
- Satellite pass optimization algorithms
- Line-of-sight calculations using terrain data
- Market demand analysis based on population density
- Regulatory exclusion zone handling

#### 4.3 Reporting and Export
- PDF report generation with maps and reasoning
- GeoJSON export of recommended sites
- CSV export of analysis results

### Phase 5: Testing and Deployment (Week 9-10)

#### 5.1 Testing
- Unit tests for spatial analysis functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Frontend component testing
- Performance testing with large datasets

#### 5.2 Deployment
- Containerization with Docker
- Database optimization and indexing
- Security implementation (authentication, input validation)
- Documentation and user guides

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Database Setup** (Priority 1):
   ```sql
   -- Enable PostGIS extension
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis_topology;
   ```

2. **Data Ingestion Scripts** (Priority 2):
   - Start with mobile carrier CSV files (simplest format)
   - Process NBN shapefiles
   - Handle Optus KML coverage data

3. **Project Structure** (Priority 3):
